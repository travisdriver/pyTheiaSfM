// The json format is documented here: 
// https://docs.nerf.studio/en/latest/quickstart/data_conventions.html
// It is assumed, that the Views in the reconstruction have the same
// name than the image filename, e.g. image001.png with extension
// The filenames in the nerfstudio json are then concatenated as:
// path_to_images + / + view_image_name
// Currently only 3 types of camera models are supported and we can
// map between nerfstudio and pytheia camera models like this:
// OPENCV -> PINHOLE
// OPENCV_FISHEYE -> FISHEYE
// EQUIRECTANGULAR -> - not supported atm
// (https://github.com/nerfstudio-project/nerfstudio/blob/main/nerfstudio/cameras/cameras.py)
// OPENCV is not mapped to PINHOLE_RADIAL_TANGENTIAL as pytheia uses
// 3 radial distortion parameteres (k1,k2,k3) and nerfstudio only 2 (k1,k2)
